# Kernel Programming Slides

My slides for presenting CUDA, Triton, and Pallas to the Audio Lab at UIUC (presentation was 1/30/25).

To compile, make sure you have [manimutils](https://github.com/CameronChurchwell/manimutils) and all of its requirements installed, and then run

```sh
manim-slides render main.py KernelSlides
```

To launch the slides, you can then run

```sh
manim-slides KernelSlides
```

That's it!
